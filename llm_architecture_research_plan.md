# LLM Architecture Experimentation Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
- [ ] Study transformer internals (Attention Is All You Need)
- [ ] Implement basic transformer from scratch
- [ ] Benchmark against reference implementations
- [ ] Set up training pipeline with small datasets

## Phase 2: Attention Experiments (Weeks 5-8)  
- [ ] Implement Multi-Query Attention (MQA)
- [ ] Test Grouped Query Attention (GQA)
- [ ] Experiment with sparse attention patterns
- [ ] Measure speed vs quality tradeoffs

## Phase 3: Efficiency Optimizations (Weeks 9-12)
- [ ] RMSNorm vs LayerNorm comparison
- [ ] SwiGLU activation function testing
- [ ] Gradient checkpointing optimizations
- [ ] Memory usage profiling

## Phase 4: Novel Architectures (Weeks 13-16)
- [ ] Mixture of Experts implementation
- [ ] Mixture of Depths experiments
- [ ] Custom positional encoding schemes
- [ ] Hybrid architecture designs

## Phase 5: Evaluation & Scaling (Weeks 17-20)
- [ ] Benchmark on standard datasets
- [ ] Scale successful architectures
- [ ] Write research paper/blog post
- [ ] Open source implementations

## Datasets for Testing
- **Small**: WikiText-2 (200MB)
- **Medium**: OpenWebText (40GB)  
- **Large**: The Pile (800GB)

## Success Metrics
- Perplexity on validation set
- Training efficiency (tokens/second)
- Memory usage per parameter
- Inference speed
- Quality on downstream tasks
